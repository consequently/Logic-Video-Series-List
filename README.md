# Logic-Video-Series-List
# What This Is?
A list of various video series on logic. I have not watched every single series here. Creating this list provides others with a resource for finding videos on this topic, improve the quality of the list, or create their own version of this list.

The content of this file is sorted by channel, each section contains a short description and links.
